                    With
                    rolling hills, amazing views, and nice people, it's the best city in PA! Contrary to some peoples'
                    belief that Philadelphia takes the cake, Pittsburgh doesn't have a heroin problem. We have an
                    amazing city skyline at night, and specific viewing locations set aside. We also have something
                    called the incline, which is a powered rail system that climbs up the side of a mountain.</p>

            <div class="single_column">
                <p> We are among the top cities in a lot of categories. Aluminum production, glass products, and
                    petroleum
                    products are among the most notable. We are also only behind New York City and Chicago on corporate
                    headquarters employment. We also have CMU, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne Unviersity.
                    Pittsburgh also has two newspaper outlets: The Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and The Tribune Review. The
                    Pittsburgh Post Gazette was founded in 1786, and the newspaper has been running ever since. The
                    Tribune
                    Review was founded in 1889, and has ceased print publication since December 1st, 2016. </p>

                <p>Pittsburgh is located at the convergence point between two rivers (the Allegheny and the
                    Monongohela), where they unite to form the Ohio river. These rivers have shaped the city, and given
                    rise to Pittsburghs many bridges. While many say that Pittsburgh has the most bridges of any city in
                    the world, it doesn't even have the most bridges in the state of Pennsylvania</p>
