      <p>
        This bridge is the longest bridge in Pittsburgh, clocking in at
        2.2km or 7,293ft. This makes it the 6th longest bridge in the state.
        Although this site isn't about the state, and interesting fact is
        that the longest bridge in PA is almost 3 miles long.

      <p>
        This bridge, while not the longest nor the most interesting is here
        strictly because of how big a mistake it was. This bridge is a main
        artery into the city, and has connects to the outlet/inlet of a
        tunnel. This bridge starts off two lanes, and then becomes four.
        Each of these lanes becomes more than one exit at the end of the
        bridge, causing it to become one of the worst highways to merge
        onto/off of.
