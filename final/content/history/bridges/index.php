  <h2>The McKees Rocks Bridge</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <p>
      The McKees Rocks Bridge is a steel truss bridge that spans the Ohio River and connects the Pittsburgh
      neighborhoods of McKees Rocks and Stowe Township. It is an important transportation artery in the region,
      providing a vital link between the northwestern suburbs of Pittsburgh and the city proper.
      <br><br>
      At 7,293 feet (2,223 meters) in length, the McKees Rocks Bridge is the longest bridge in the Pittsburgh area. It
      was designed by engineer John A. Roebling, who is best known for his work on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.
      The bridge was opened to traffic in 1931 and was considered an engineering marvel at the time, with its innovative
      design and use of modern materials.
      <br><br>
      Although the McKees Rocks Bridge is not the longest bridge in Pennsylvania, it is an impressive feat of
      engineering and an important part of the region's history. It has undergone several renovations and repairs over
      the years to ensure its continued safe operation, and it remains an essential link in the transportation network
      of the Pittsburgh area.
      <br><br>
      In addition to its functional value, the McKees Rocks Bridge is also a popular destination for tourists and locals
      alike. It offers stunning views of the Pittsburgh skyline and the Ohio River, and it is a favorite spot for
      photographers and sightseers.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the McKees Rocks Bridge is an important landmark in the Pittsburgh area and a testament to the region's
      rich engineering heritage. Its unique design and long history make it a cherished part of the local community, and
      it is sure to continue to be a beloved destination for generations to come.

  <h2>The Fort Pitt Bridge</h2>
  <div class="row">

    <p>
      The Fort Pitt Bridge is a steel cantilever bridge that spans the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It
      is an important transportation artery in the region, providing a vital link between downtown Pittsburgh and the
      city's southern suburbs.
      <br><br>
      While the Fort Pitt Bridge is not the longest or most interesting bridge in Pittsburgh, it is known for its
      challenging design and layout. The bridge is a main artery into the city and connects to the outlet/inlet of the
      Fort Pitt Tunnel, which runs underneath Mount Washington.
      <br><br>
      The Fort Pitt Bridge starts off as a two-lane roadway and then expands to four lanes. Each of these lanes becomes
      more than one exit at the end of the bridge, causing it to become one of the worst highways to merge onto/off of.
      This design flaw has resulted in significant traffic congestion and frustration for drivers, especially during
      rush hour and peak travel times.
      <br><br>
      Despite its design challenges, the Fort Pitt Bridge remains an important part of the region's transportation
      network. It provides a vital link between downtown Pittsburgh and the southern suburbs, and it is used by
      thousands of commuters and travelers every day.
      <br><br>
      In addition to its functional value, the Fort Pitt Bridge is also a popular destination for tourists and locals
      alike. It offers stunning views of the Pittsburgh skyline and the Monongahela River, and it is a favorite spot for
      photographers and sightseers.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the Fort Pitt Bridge is a testament to the challenges of designing and building infrastructure in a
      dense, urban environment. While its design flaws have caused headaches for drivers over the years, it remains an
      important part of the city's transportation network and a beloved part of the local landscape.
