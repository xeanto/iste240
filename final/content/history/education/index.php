    <h3 class="center">University of Pittsburgh</h3>
    <p>
        The University of Pittsburgh, also known as Pitt, is the largest university in Pittsburgh by
        size. It is a state-related school, which means that it receives funding from the state of
        Pennsylvania but is not part of the state's formal university system. While Pitt is often known
        as a party school, it has a strong engineering program that competes with the best engineering
        schools in the country. The Swanson School of Engineering at Pitt offers a range of
        undergraduate and graduate programs in fields such as bioengineering, chemical engineering, and
        civil engineering.
        <br><br>
        In addition to its engineering program, the University of Pittsburgh is also known for its
        strong medical and healthcare programs. The university is home to the highly ranked University
        of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which includes multiple hospitals and research centers. The
        university also offers programs in law, business, education, and social sciences, among others.
        While in-state students do not receive the same benefits as those attending a state school, Pitt
        offers a range of scholarships and financial aid programs to help make tuition more affordable.
