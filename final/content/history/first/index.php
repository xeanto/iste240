        <h1 class="center">The History of Pittsburgh</h1>
        <p>Pittsburgh was officially founded on November 27th, 1758. It was named after John Forbes, who was a
            British salesman. Pittsbrguh played an important role in the history of our country. Known as the
            Gateway of the West, the intersection of the rivers played a large part in the early growth of the city.
            These waterways enabled trade throughout the midwest, since the rivers connected a large part of the
            lands to the west of the city. As settlers were now able to travel further without the aid of horse or
            on their own feet, more exploration was able to be done, allowing for the "Next Great Frontier" to be
            explored. </p>

        <p>Coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone were the main resources traded. All of these natural
            resources were combined to make steel, at some point or another. This being one of the city's greatest
            strenghts, its steel production, meant the city got polluted a crazy amount as a result. This caused the
            top of buildings to become caked with soot, earning the city the nickname of "The Smoky City".
            Pittsburgh has come a long way, though. After the streets were incredibly polluted, the city made
            efforts to revitalize them. They have come a long way, and some would say that these parts of the city
            are now even modernized. </p>
