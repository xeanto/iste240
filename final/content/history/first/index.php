            <h1 class="center">The History of Pittsburgh</h1>
            <p>Pittsburgh was officially founded on November 27th, 1758. It was named after John Forbes, who was a
                British salesman. Pittsbrguh played an important role in the history of our country. Known as the
                Gateway of the West, the intersection of the rivers played a large part in the early growth of the city.
                These waterways enabled trade throughout the midwest, since the rivers connected a large part of the
                lands to the west of the city. As settlers were now able to travel further without the aid of horse or
                on their own feet, more exploration was able to be done, allowing for the "Next Great Frontier" to be
                explored. </p>

        <div class="content_column">
            <p>Coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone were the main resources traded. All of these natural
                resources were combined to make steel, at some point or another. This being one of the city's greatest
                strenghts, its steel production, meant the city got polluted a crazy amount as a result. This caused the
                top of buildings to become caked with soot, earning the city the nickname of "The Smoky City".
                Pittsburgh has come a long way, though. After the streets were incredibly polluted, the city made
                efforts to revitalize them. They have come a long way, and some would say that these parts of the city
                are now even modernized. </p>
