    <h2 class="center">William "Billy" Strayhorn.</h2>
    <p>William "Billy" Strayhorn was a renowned composer and arranger of jazz music, best known for his work
        with Duke Ellington. Born in Ohio in 1915, Strayhorn grew up mostly in Pittsburgh and was heavily
        influenced by the city's vibrant music scene. He began working with Ellington in the early 1940s and
        collaborated with him on some of his most famous compositions, including "Take the A Train" and
        "Satin Doll." Strayhorn was openly gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal, and his personal
        struggles with discrimination and addiction often found their way into his music. He died in 1967 at
        the age of 51, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest jazz composers of all time.

        Andy Warhol is another notable figure from Pittsburgh. Born in the city in 1928, Warhol was a
        leading figure in the Pop Art movement of the 1960s. He gained fame for his colorful, bold prints of
        everyday objects such as Campbell's Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. Warhol also made a name for
        himself as a filmmaker, producing avant-garde movies such as "Chelsea Girls" and "Empire." He was
        known for his eccentric personality and love of celebrity culture, and his Studio 54 parties were
        legendary. Warhol died in 1987 at the age of 58, but his influence on art and popular culture
        continues to this day.

        George Romero was a filmmaker known for his contributions to the horror genre. Born in New York City
        in 1940, Romero moved to Pittsburgh in the 1950s and attended Carnegie Mellon University. He gained
        fame in the late 1960s with his groundbreaking film "Night of the Living Dead," which is widely
        regarded as one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Romero continued to make horror movies
        throughout his career, often exploring themes of social commentary and satire. He died in 2017 at
        the age of 77, but his legacy as a master of horror continues to inspire filmmakers and scare
        audiences to this day.

        August Wilson is another notable figure from Pittsburgh. Born in the Hill District of Pittsburgh in
        1945, Wilson went on to become one of the greatest playwrights of the 20th century. He was best
        known for his ten-play cycle, which chronicled the lives of African Americans in different decades
        of the 20th century. The cycle included plays such as "Fences," "The Piano Lesson," and "Ma Rainey's
        Black Bottom," and earned Wilson two Pulitzer Prizes for Drama. Wilson died in 2005 at the age of
        60, but his work continues to be performed and studied in theaters and universities around the
        world.
