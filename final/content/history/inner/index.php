        <h1 class="center">What to know about living in the city?</h1>
        <p>Glad you asked! Here are a few things to know about this city before moving here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>It's a great place to work!</strong> <br>We are third for corporate HQ occupancy in the
                    United
                    States!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The infrastructure both loves you and hates you!</strong> <br>Your car is going to hate
                    it
                    here, though. The northeastern winters bring a LOT of salt, for about 4 months out of the year
                    which means your car will be very rusty within a few winters here. Our infrastructure is just as
                    bad, with our highways looking like a spider web in some places, while our roads look like
                    pegboard they have so many potholes. On the positive side, though you will be able to reach your
                    destination in less time than you think. Our web of interconnected roadways leads to short
                    travel times.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Great Parks!</strong><br>
                    We have some of the best parks around, in addition to the city being surrounded by forest in
                    almost every direction! Not sure if they're counted as parks, but golf courses are abundant here
                    in Pittsburgh</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>We've got you covered on sports events.</strong><br>
                    Pittsburgh has both a NFL and an MLB team, although their prowess is up in the air. How good
                    they are aside, the games are stil fun to attend, especially if you go to the after parties.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Our food has an insane variety.</strong><br>
                    Not only are they close together, but they're vast in diversity and variety. Our restauraunt
                    districts have everything you could want, from boba tea and sushi all the way to an American
                    style diner.</p>
            </li>
