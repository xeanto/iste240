        <h1>Pittsburghians</h1>
        <p>A century ago this city was the 9th most populated city in the US.</p>
        <p>They have their own slang to an extent. Yinzers = Y'all, gumband = rubberband, grinnie = chipmunk.
            The demographic is mostly made up of Scottish-Irish immigrants, which explains the slang.
