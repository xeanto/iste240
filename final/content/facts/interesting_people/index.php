        <h2>Pittsburghese: Taking a look at the Pittsburgh Dialect</h2>
        <p>Having grown up in Pittsburgh, I'm intimately familiar with the dialect of the people I grew up with. There
            are actually quite a few specific phrases and words found in Pittsburgh, like <span
                class="code">gumband</span>
            or <span class="code">yinz</span>.</p>
        <h3>Yinz</h3>
