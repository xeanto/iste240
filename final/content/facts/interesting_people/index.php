        <h2>Pittsburghese: Taking a look at the Pittsburgh Dialect</h2>
        <p>Having grown up in Pittsburgh, I'm intimately familiar with the dialect of the people I grew up with. There
            are actually quite a few specific phrases and words found in Pittsburgh, like <a href="#gumband"
                class="code"> <span class="code">gumband</span></a>
            or <a href="#yinz"><span class="code">yinz</span></a>.</p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="yinz">Yinz</h3>
        <p>
            This might be the most well known out of all of the dialects. Yinz is a word that is used in place of y'all.
            It's a contraction of "you ones" and is used in place of the plural form of you. For example, "Are yinz
            going to the game tonight?" is a common phrase in Pittsburgh. It's thought to have originated from Scottish
            "Yins" which means 'ones'.</p>
        <p>
            The word has become so ingrained in the culture, that you can find it on advertisements and other forms of
            media. It might even be found on signs throughout the city. Some examples may include:<br>
            <span class="code quote">Yinz comin to the party?</span> or <span class="code quote">What're yinz
                doin?</span>
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="gumband">Gumband</h3>
        <p>
            This is another word that is used in place of a more common word. Gumband is used in place of rubber band.
            It's thought to have originated from the word gum, which is a type of rubber. It's also thought to have
            originated from the word <a href="#gumshoes"><span class="code">gumshoes</span></a> which is a type of
            shoe that has a rubber sole.
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="gumshoes">Gumshoes</h3>
        <p>
            In the Pittsburgh dialect, "gumshoes" is a term used to refer to sneakers or athletic shoes. The origin of
            this term is not entirely clear, but it is believed to have originated from the early 20th century when
            shoes with rubber soles were becoming more popular.<span class="br"></span>

            Some sources suggest that "gumshoes" may have originated as a brand name for a specific type of shoe,
            similar to how "Keds" or "Converse" are brand names for specific types of sneakers. However, the term has
            since become a general term used to refer to any type of athletic shoe.<span class="br"></span>

            In Pittsburgh, you might hear someone say something like "I need to buy a new pair of gumshoes" or "I'm
            wearing my gumshoes today." The term is used fairly commonly in the region, and you may even see it used in
            advertisements for shoes or athletic gear marketed towards Pittsburghers.<span class="br"></span>

            Overall, the term "gumshoes" is a unique example of the way language evolves and adapts to specific regions
            and cultures. While it may not be a term that's widely used outside of Pittsburgh, it's an important part of
            the city's dialect and cultural heritage.<span class="br"></span>
