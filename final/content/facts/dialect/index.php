        <h2>Pittsburghese: Taking a look at the Pittsburgh Dialect</h2>
        <p>Having grown up in Pittsburgh, I'm intimately familiar with the dialect of the people I grew up with. There
            are actually quite a few specific phrases and words found in Pittsburgh, like <a href="#gumband"
                class="code"> <span class="code">gumband</span></a>
            or <a href="#yinz"><span class="code">yinz</span></a>.</p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="yinz">Yinz</h3>
        <p>
            This might be the most well known out of all of the dialects. Yinz is a word that is used in place of y'all.
            It's a contraction of "you ones" and is used in place of the plural form of you. For example, "Are yinz
            going to the game tonight?" is a common phrase in Pittsburgh. It's thought to have originated from Scottish
            "Yins" which means 'ones'.</p>
        <p>
            The word has become so ingrained in the culture, that you can find it on advertisements and other forms of
            media. It might even be found on signs throughout the city. Some examples may include:<br>
            <span class="code quote">Yinz comin to the party?</span> or <span class="code quote">What're yinz
                doin?</span>
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="gumband">Gumband</h3>
        <p>
            This is another word that is used in place of a more common word. Gumband is used in place of rubber band.
            It's thought to have originated from the word gum, which is a type of rubber. It's also thought to have
            originated from the word <a href="#gumshoes"><span class="code">gumshoes</span></a> which is a type of
            shoe that has a rubber sole.
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="gumshoes">Gumshoes</h3>
        <p>
            In the Pittsburgh dialect, "gumshoes" is a term used to refer to sneakers or athletic shoes. The origin of
            this term is not entirely clear, but it is believed to have originated from the early 20th century when
            shoes with rubber soles were becoming more popular.<span class="br"></span>

            Some sources suggest that "gumshoes" may have originated as a brand name for a specific type of shoe,
            similar to how "Keds" or "Converse" are brand names for specific types of sneakers. However, the term has
            since become a general term used to refer to any type of athletic shoe.<span class="br"></span>

            In Pittsburgh, you might hear someone say something like "I need to buy a new pair of gumshoes" or "I'm
            wearing my gumshoes today." The term is used fairly commonly in the region, and you may even see it used in
            advertisements for shoes or athletic gear marketed towards Pittsburghers.<span class="br"></span>

            Overall, the term "gumshoes" is a unique example of the way language evolves and adapts to specific regions
            and cultures. While it may not be a term that's widely used outside of Pittsburgh, it's an important part of
            the city's dialect and cultural heritage.<span class="br"></span>

        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="reddup">Reddup</h3>
        <p>
            One term you might hear in Pittsburgh is "redd up," which means to clean up or tidy up. It's thought to have
            originated from Scottish and Northern English dialects, and it's a term that has been used in Pittsburgh for
            many years. You might hear someone say something like "I need to redd up my house before my family comes to
            visit."
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="nat">
            N'at
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of the most distinctive features of the Pittsburgh dialect is the use of "n'at" at the end of sentences.
            This phrase is short for "and all that" and is used to add emphasis or include additional information. For
            example, someone might say "I'm going to the store to pick up some milk n'at." While the use of "n'at" may
            seem odd to outsiders, it is an accepted part of the Pittsburgh dialect and a source of pride for many
            Pittsburghers.
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="jagoff">Jagoff</h3>
        <p>
            Another common word in the Pittsburgh dialect is "jagoff," which is used as a general insult. It's
            thought to have originated from the word "jackass," and it's a term that is used in many different
            situations. For example, someone might say "That guy is such a jagoff" or "Don't be such a jagoff." It's
            also used as a verb, as in "He jagged me off." Quite often this word will be herad in the middle of
            downtown,
            as someone is inevitably getting sold something or being run into.
        </p>
        <hr class="content-divide">
        <h3 id="nebby">Nebby</h3>
        <p>
            One of the more common words in the Pittsburgh dialect is "nebby," which means nosy or curious. It's
            thought to have originated from the word "nosey," and it's a term that is used in many different
            situations. For example, someone might say "Don't be so nebby" or "I'm not being nebby." It's also used as
            an adjective, as in "He's a nebby person." The word is used so frequently that it has become a part of
            everyday speech for many Pittsburghers.
