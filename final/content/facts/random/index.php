            The Steel Mills
        </h2>
        <p>
            When it was founded, Pittsburgh was the center of industry and provided a lot of the raw materials for
            the US economy. This continued for a while, all the way until after WW2. Since the end of the 80's,
            though, the city has slowly been declining in importance for the United States steel supply. The
            industry was so successful that it is widely considered one of the most exemplary industrial successes.
            Between the 1970's and the 1980's, the steel industry had collapsed faced with foreign competition. Many
            steel mills had been closed, and the city was in an economic depression.

            Pittsburgh, a city once known for its steel mills and heavy industry, has experienced a renaissance in

            New Science
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pittsburgh is a city with a rich history of scientific achievement. In 1953, Dr. Jonas Salk and his team at
            the University of Pittsburgh developed the world's first polio vaccine, which was a major breakthrough in
            the fight against this devastating disease. The vaccine was a turning point in the history of public health
            and saved countless lives around the world. Another landmark scientific achievement in Pittsburgh is the
            display of the world's first Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, which can be seen at the Carnegie Museum of Natural
            History. Discovered in Montana in 1902, the skeleton was excavated and reconstructed over a period of years,
            and today it stands as an iconic symbol of the museum's commitment to scientific research and education.
            These two scientific accomplishments are just a small sample of the many ways in which Pittsburgh has
            contributed to our understanding of the world around us.

        <h2>
            William Pitt
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pittsburgh has a long and storied history that dates back to its founding in 1758. The city was named after
            William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, a British statesman who played a key role in the Seven Years' War between
            Britain and France. Pittsburgh was strategically located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela
            Rivers, making it a valuable location for trade and transportation. In its early years, Pittsburgh was a
            frontier town that was home to fur traders, soldiers, and frontiersmen. As the town grew, it became a center
            of industry and commerce, with a thriving economy based on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.
            Pittsburgh was also an important site for the Underground Railroad during the years leading up to the Civil
            War, as escaped slaves made their way north to freedom. Today, Pittsburgh is a vibrant and diverse city that
            honors its rich history while embracing innovation and progress.
