            <p>One of only 2 football franchises to win the Superbowl 6 times. The other is the New England
                Patriots. They are also one of only 6 franchises that don't have their own cheerleading squad. They
                played their first playoff game against the Oakland Raiders in 1972. </p>
            <p>Odd tidbit; in 1943 they merged with the Eagles to become the Steagles.</p>
