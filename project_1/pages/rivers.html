            <h1>The Allegheny River</h1>
            <p>The Allegheny river is 325 miles long and runs through NY and PA. Personally, wouldn't recommend eating
                anything that came out of this river, since Pittsburgh used to be an industrial city. Nothing in the
                rivers is safe for human consumption, considering the amount of stuff that was polluted in the water and
                surrounding area. </p>
            <h1>The Monongahela River</h1>
            <p>
                Starts in WV, and joins the Allegheny at "the point" to form the Ohio river.
            </p>
            <h1>The Ohio River</h1>
            <p>
                The Ohio river starts in Pittsburgh and flows all the to the Mississippi river. It's 981 miles long, and
                is also the largets tributary to the Mississippi river. This is the river that allowed Pittsburgh to
                become a key city in the exploration of the west, as it was used as a checkpoint along the way.
