            <h1 class="center">What to know about living in the city?</h1>
            <p>Glad you asked! Here are a few things to know about this city before moving here.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>It's a great place to work!</strong> <br>We are third for corporate HQ occupancy in the
                        United
                        States!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>The infrastructure both loves you and hates you!</strong> <br>Your car is going to hate
                        it
                        here, though. The northeastern winters bring a LOT of salt, for about 4 months out of the year
                        which means your car will be very rusty within a few winters here. Our infrastructure is just as
                        bad, with our highways looking like a spider web in some places, while our roads look like
                        pegboard they have so many potholes. On the positive side, though you will be able to reach your
                        destination in less time than you think. Our web of interconnected roadways leads to short
                        travel times.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Great Parks!</strong><br>
                        We have some of the best parks around, in addition to the city being surrounded by forest in
                        almost every direction! Not sure if they're counted as parks, but golf courses are abundant here
                        in Pittsburgh</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>We've got you covered on sports events.</strong><br>
                        Pittsburgh has both a NFL and an MLB team, although their prowess is up in the air. How good
                        they are aside, the games are stil fun to attend, especially if you go to the after parties.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Our food has an insane variety.</strong><br>
                    Not only are they close together, but they're vast in diversity and variety. Our restauraunt districts have everything you could want, from boba tea and sushi all the way to an American style diner.</p>
